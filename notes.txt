what is RabbitMQ?

how RabbitMQ was used in the project when I joined?
how did the inter-component communication look like at that time (HTTP, unreliable)

publish to exchange, consume from a queue
exchange types - direct, fanout (broadcast), headers, topic

showcase:
1) work-queue
2) fanout-exchange
3) json-content-type
4) message adapter

strong persistence guarantee
dead letter queue

Apache Camel
